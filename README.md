# PHYS 325: Methods of Computational Physics Assignment 7.1 - Animated Orbital System

## Project Overview

Project Assignment Outline PDF: [project_assignment.pdf](docs/project_assignment.pdf) </br>
</br>
This project relates to my CISC 480: Senior Capstone course because it was the most difficult assignment I worked on during my Methods of Computational Physics at the University of St. Thomas. As part of the Physics (B.S.) curriculum, this course involved elements of numerical estimation, including: the implementation of differential equations to modeled coupled-motion of multiple bodies, ....

NOTE: All code in this repository has been cleaned up since the completion of this course to be featured in my senior portfolio.

## Project Description

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of PyGame, a Python package for integrated animation and data visualization. By using a multi-body orbital simulation program, we can track the movement of multiple bodies through a simulation space (*i.e.* our Solar System). 

## Installation Process
